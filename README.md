# Ultimate Arch Scripts
`My custom scripts for arch linux`

Arch is a great distro. But setting it up can be a bit of a pain. So,
## This repo contains scripts that can be used to automate that process with no bloat with a minimalistic approach. 

# Getting Started
## `Post Setup`
-  **Boot into your arch iso and be sure that you are in UEFI mode**
- **Verify boot mode:** `cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size` should return 64 
- - **Connect to the internet:** `ping 1.1.1.1` should respond otherwise, use USB tether from you phone
- **Partition:** `lsblk`, then `cfdisk`. Delete partition or create new one from here.![[,images/Pasted image 20240702134505.png]]
- Remember to create a separate home partition because of the install script.
- Use curl to get the mirror.sh script and run it.
  `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aqu1nEq/arch-scripts/main/mirror.sh`
  `chmod +x mirror.sh`
- Execute `mirror.sh` by running:
```
./mirror.sh [nearest country] [another nearest country]
```
Exmaple : `./mirror.sh US Canada`

## `Installation`
